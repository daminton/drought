Alabama,Montgomery,Severely Dry,20 or more years,Once,,2016,,"Drought conditions on our farm in northern Montgomery County have been on-going since August.  Increased in September and accelerated drastically in October.  Extreme heat and lack of rain in this area within the south is the prime example of an accelerated flash drought.  Rainfall data collected on the farm is significantly lower since August.  Respectfully, we feel the current drought monitor is not given an accurate representation as to what is taking place on the farm.  The drought monitor does not take into account agriculture forage availability.  We have been in a critical stage for over 90-days.  We feel the northern portion of Montgomery County should highly be considered as a D3 drought area based on the information stated above.  Conditions are the same as  the fall of 2016 when we experienced a state wide drought.
